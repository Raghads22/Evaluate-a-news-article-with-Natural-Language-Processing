# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview

This project is a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. By leveraging an external API, the application can classify the content of an article as subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based) and determine its tone (positive, neutral, or negative).

The project is built with modern front-end technologies such as Webpack, Express, and Node.js. It includes a development and production environment setup, service workers for offline functionality, and Jest for unit testing.
